## Functional Programming Assignment (University Coursework)

Coursework for Stage 2 Functional Programming module.

This repository contains coursework from my second year module on functional programming.

7 Exercises, 7 extracts from Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles, encrypted with ciphers dicussed in the module.

The focus was on:
- using a decision tree to make the moves for the AI
- write the central game server to co-ordinate the players and game board.

Status: Complete for coursework requirements.
Notes:
- This was done with time constraints while learning Haskell at the time.

This repository is preserved as evidence of academic work and learning progress.
